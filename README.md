 ## Description
 The purpose of this prohject was to build a blog site that could allow users to signup, login, create blogs, view other blogs, and comment on other user's blogs. The purpose of this project was to also create this website by building the front end and the back end from scratch while using MySQL2 for the database, Sequelize to organize the database, handlebars for the front end, express to connect to the back end, JSON Web Token for user authentication, and bycrpt to encrypt user passwords. The motivation behind this project was to create a website that allows other software engineers to share their thoughts and opinions on topics which other users can comment on. This project has taught me how to connect the front end and the back end of a web application while setting up user authentication and password encryption to protect sensitive user information.

## Installation
To properly run this application, clone a copy of the repository from GitHub. Install inquirer by typing "npm install inqurier@8.2.4". Install mysql as well. Open MySql using the MySql shell, and create a database called "ecommerce_db". Exit out of the Mysql shell, and run "npm run seed" in the CLI to seed the database with values. Next, run node server.js to connect to the server. Open up Insomnia Core and create requests to view, create, update, or delete values from the tables.
