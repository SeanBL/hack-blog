 ## Description
 The purpose of this prohject was to build a blog site that could allow users to signup, login, create blogs, view other blogs, and comment on other user's blogs. The purpose of this project was to also create this website by building the front end and the back end from scratch while using MySQL2 for the database, Sequelize to organize the database, handlebars for the front end, express to connect to the back end, JSON Web Token for user authentication, and bycrpt to encrypt user passwords. The motivation behind this project was to create a website that allows other software engineers to share their thoughts and opinions on topics which other users can comment on. This project has taught me how to connect the front end and the back end of a web application while setting up user authentication and password encryption to protect sensitive user information.

Once the user clicks on the website link above, the user will be taken to the homepage. The user will be able to see all posts displayed on the homepage, but will need to sign up and then login to access the "dashboard". Once the user is logged in, the user may comment on existing posts found on the homepage. From the dashboard, the user may create new blog posts which will show up on the homepage. The user may also update and delete any of their own posts by clicking on any one of their own posts from the dashboard. A logout button can be found at the navigation bar if the user wishes to logout.
